# fasttdc
Cosmological likelihood evaluation for time-delay cosmography (TDC). 

- Likelihood evaluation: TDCLikelihood() and TDCKinLikelihood() in tdc_sampler.py

- Running MCMC inference: fast_TDC() in tdc_sampler.py

- See test cases in tests/tdc_sampler_tests.py

This code was developed for the analysis in Erickson et al. (in DESC IR). 

- See Experiments/lsst_forecast for further details.
